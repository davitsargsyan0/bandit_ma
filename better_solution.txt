To improve the current implementation, we can introduce a more realistic simulation by modeling user behavior through a custom environment that simulates different user types (e.g., conservative vs. impulsive responders). This enhances the validity of reward signals beyond simple Gaussian noise. Additionally, upgrading to contextual bandits using LinUCB or neural models would enable personalized decision-making based on user features like time of day, demographics, or device typeâ€”offering better real-world applicability.

From a tooling perspective, real-time visualizations via Streamlit or Plotly Dash would allow monitoring algorithm performance live. Switching from CSV to Parquet or Feather format improves efficiency and scalability. Running multiple experiment batches with different seeds provides statistically robust results, and generating an auto-summary HTML report with plots, parameters, and performance metrics would enhance usability and reproducibility.
